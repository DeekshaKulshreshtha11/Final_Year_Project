# Final_Year_Project
My final year project involved the development of a handwritten digit classification system using an Artificial Neural Network (ANN) based on machine learning techniques. The project was implemented using Keras, Matplotlib, and other Python libraries.</br>

The system is designed to recognize digits written on a graphical user interface (GUI) and accurately classify them from 0 to 9 using the MNIST dataset. The system also includes an audio output that pronounces the recognized digit.</br>

Overall, the project demonstrates proficiency in designing and implementing a machine learning-based image classification system, utilizing widely used deep learning libraries, and integrating multimedia output for a more user-friendly experience.</br>
